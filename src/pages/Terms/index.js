            <p>
              You acknowledge and agree that the Licensed NFTs are made solely
              for entertainment purposes only. You acknowledge and agree that
              you assume the following risks: (1) the market and prices for a
              blockchain asset such as a Licensed NFT are extremely volatile and
              subjective, and fluctuations in the price could materially and
              adversely affect the price and value of your Licensed NFT(s); (2)
              collectible blockchain assets, such as the Licensed NFTs, have no
              inherent or intrinsic value and there is no guarantee that your
              Licensed NFT(s) will have or retain any value; (3) risks involved
              with using Internet-native currencies, cryptocurrencies and/or
              digital assets, including, but not limited to, risks of hardware,
              software, Internet connection failures, risks of malicious
              software introduction, and risks that unauthorised persons may
              gain access to your personal information including information and
              assets contained in your digital wallet or elsewhere; (4) risk of
              changes to the regulatory regime governing NFTs and new
              regulations, unfavourable regulatory intervention in one or more
              jurisdictions or policies; (5) risk that you may lose access to
              the Licensed NFTs due to, amongst other scenarios, loss of private
              keys, custodial error, or user error; (6) risks related to
              taxation; and (7) risks of hacking, security weaknesses, fraud,
              counterfeiting, cyber-attacks and other technological
              difficulties. Any of these risks may materially adversely affect
              the use and value of the Licensed NFTs.
